1. Create an A.I. model that can play flappy bird and improve
2. Use Reinforcement Learning:
State Space: Define the state representation 
(e.g., bird's position, velocity, distance to the next pipe).
Action Space: Define the possible actions (e.g., flap or no flap).
Reward Function: Design a reward function 
(e.g., +1 for passing a pipe, -100 for 
hitting a pipe, +0.1 for staying alive).
