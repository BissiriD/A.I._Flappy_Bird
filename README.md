**Flappy Bird AI with Reinforcement Learning**


**Overview**
- This project demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning to train an AI agent to play the Flappy Bird game. The AI is implemented using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with PyTorch, interfaced with a custom OpenAI Gym environment that integrates with the game logic built using Pygame.

**Features**
- Custom Gym Environment: A custom environment was built to bridge the Flappy Bird game logic with the reinforcement learning agent.
- Deep Q-Network (DQN): The AI is trained using a DQN implemented with PyTorch, leveraging experience replay and epsilon-greedy strategies.
- Pygame Integration: The game logic and real-time rendering are handled using Pygame, allowing the agent to interact with a visual environment.
- Stable Baselines3: The model training is managed using the Stable Baselines3 library, enabling easy experimentation with different reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Various hyperparameters were tuned to optimize the agent's performance, including learning rate, discount factor, and exploration-exploitation balance.
- Getting Started
- Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Git

**Results**
- After training, the AI agent can successfully play Flappy Bird, achieving a high score that surpasses human performance. The agent learns to navigate through the pipes by flapping at the right moments, demonstrating the effectiveness of the reinforcement learning approach.

**Technologies Used**
- Python: Programming language used for all code.
- PyTorch: Framework for building and training the Deep Q-Network.
- Pygame: Library used for game development and rendering.
- Gym: Toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Stable Baselines3: High-level reinforcement learning library built on top of PyTorch.
- NumPy: Library for numerical operations.
